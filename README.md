# bookio - WIP project
ASP.NET Core books SPA, similar to Goodreads.

Features I'll try to implement:
1. Browse through books
2. Browse through authors
3. Search books / authors
4. Follow authors
5. Leave comments
6. Leave reviews
7. DM users
8. Set a book as 'currently reading' or 'read'
9. Other

The sole purpose of this project is to help me learn more about Razor pages, Blazor and ASP.NET Core in general.
